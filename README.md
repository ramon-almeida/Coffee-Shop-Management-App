> -Requirements

- To be able to create and update data as products, couriers and orders

- All data have to be persisted and not lost, and load all persisted data when you run the app

- To be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.


> -How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

- So far, I have created the code to meet all the requirements of creating new products, curiers and orders, and also modify each of them.
- I have also created 3 CVS files to keep the data of products, couriers and orders in these files
- If the user creates a new product, courier or order, or modifies any of these, it is automatically added to the corresponding file.


> -How did you guarantee the client requirements?

-  I have done 3 unit tests for each menu and expect input.


> What is one thing you would improve upon?

- Connect to an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine
- To create more functions to test requirements such as, adding data to CVS file and modifying them.


> -What did you most enjoy implementing?

- I really enjoyed implementing tabulate module to display list of products, couriers and orders in tablet format.
