# Generationproject

-Requirements

•To be able to create and update data as products, couriers and orders
•All data have to be persisted and not lost, and load all persisted data when you run the app
•To be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

-How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

•So far, I have created the code to meet all the requirements of creating new products, curiers and orders, and also modify each of them.
•I have also created 3 CVS files to keep the data of products, couriers and orders in these files
•If the user creates a new product, courier or order, or modifies any of these, it is automatically added to the corresponding file.

-How did you guarantee the client requirements?

•So far I have done 3 unit tests for each menu and expect input.

-If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?

•Organize files in folders like src, data and test and move functions from main-project file to functions file
•My idea is to create more functions to test requirements such as, adding data to CVS file and modifying them.

-What did you most enjoy implementing?

•I really enjoyed implementing tabulate module to display list of products, couriers and orders in tablet format.
