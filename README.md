-How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

•When we start my application, all saved data is loaded and available.
•When we exit my application, all data that has been added or modified is automatically saved.
•So far, I have created the code to meet all the requirements of creating new products, curiers and orders, and also modify each of them.
•I have also created 3 CVS files to keep the data of products, couriers and orders in these files
•If the user creates a new product, courier or order, or modifies any of these, it is automatically added to the corresponding file.

-How did you guarantee the client requirements?

•So far I have done 3 unit tests for each menu and expect input.

-If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?

•My idea is to create more functions to test requirements such as, adding data to CVS file and modifying them.
